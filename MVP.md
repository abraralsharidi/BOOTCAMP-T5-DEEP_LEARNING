# Sin Language Reognition 
The goal of this project is to build Convelution Neural Network(CNN) 
deep learning models that decide which is the letter based on the shape of the hand in sign language
and bridging the the gap in the process of communication between the Deaf and Dumb people with rest of the world.

## Sample of Dataset


## Workflow




## Next step 

We will use Real Time Sign Language Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection and Python
